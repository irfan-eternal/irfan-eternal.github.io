My Aim was to reduce switchig Between Windows as less as possible. So I found the Windows i used the most and Combined them in the Main CodeBrowser Window. The Sections in My CodeBrowser Windows are Symbol Tree Data Type Manager Listing Window Function Graph Function Call Graph Decompiler Defined Strings Console Bookmarks Python I won’t Recommend you to use this Same Sections. Try to find the Windows you use the most and Combine them in the CodeBrowser. You Can add this Windows by Visiting Windows \u003e “Windows you want to View”. After that Adjust them by Dragging the Windows Ghidra Lets you Cutomize the Code Browser by Visiting Edit \u003e Tool Options.An option which helped me a lot is Cursor Text Highlighting Cursor Text Highlighting : Edit \u003e Tool Options \u003e Cursor Text Highlight \u003e Mouse Button to Activate : LEFT (This will Highlight the Ocuurence of a Selected string in Listing/Decompiler Window) ","date":"2022-11-23","objectID":"/improving-my-ghidra-gui--ghidra-skills/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Improving My Ghidra GUI + Ghidra Skills","uri":"/improving-my-ghidra-gui--ghidra-skills/"},{"categories":["Malware Analysis"],"content":"Key Bindings Ghidra Key Bindings helps you to perform Actions related to Ghidra.

For proper analysis we need to convert this to an Unmapped Binary. We can make sure that the binary is mapped by looking at the raw address of first section, it will be always 1000 . For unmapped binaries the first section starts at 400. The tools we will be using are PE-bear and HxD Purpose The purpose of unmapping a File is to make the sections line up correctly.In the mapped PE, sections are not lined up correctly due to this we cannot see informations like imports and exports of the PE. By unmapping we can make the sections line up correctly and view informations like imports and exports of the PE Steps Open the File in PE-bear go to the Section Hdrs tab Make the Raw address match the Virtual address of Sections Set the Raw size and Virtual size correctly using this formula Raw size of Section n = VA of section n+1 - VA of section n Ex : Raw size of first Section(.text 22000) = Virtual Address of Section 2 (.rdata = 23000) - Virtual Address of Section 1 (.text = 1000) Follow this formula for all Other section except reloc Make the Virtual Size match the Raw size for all sections except reloc Make reloc size 0 Because reloc section only exist in disk . since we have dumped the pe from memory it won’t have reloc section Go to Optional Header tab and make sure the image base is same as the packed binary’s image Base This is the Final Unmapped PE.
